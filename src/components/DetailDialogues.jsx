      <h4>How does the calculator work?</h4>
      <p>
        <a href="https://citizensclimatelobby.org/household-impact-study/" target="_blank">CCL's Household Impact Study</a> estimates the direct financial effect of a
        <a href="https://citizensclimatelobby.org/carbon-fee-and-dividend/" target="_blank"> carbon tax and dividend</a> policy for a large, representative sample of U.S. households. Techniques,
        data, and assumptions are described in detail in the associated <a href="https://11bup83sxdss1xze1i3lpol4-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ummel-Impact-of-CCL-CFD-Policy-v1_4.pdf" target="_blank">working paper</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The calculator uses the studyâ€™s results to calculate:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span className="font-weight-bold">an estimate of a household's additional costs</span> under the policy (due to higher prices for goods and services), depending
          on a limited set of household characteristics (income, number of vehicles etc.).
        </li>
        <li><span className="font-weight-bold">the expected dividend</span>, which is a function of the household's number of adults, number of minors, and
          expected federal marginal tax rate.
        </li>
        <li><span className="font-weight-bold">the "net benefit per month"</span> -- the difference between the dividend and additional cost - positive if a household
          is likely to "come out ahead" under CF&D.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>How accurate is the calculator?</h4>
      <p>
        For ease of use, a small and generally easy-to-recall set of user inputs are solicited. The calculator reports the expected average outcome for a household.
        The actual outcome for any specific household could vary from the average. For example, if your household is a below-average consumer of carbon-intensive goods
        like air travel and meat, the calculator will understate the net benefit (and vice-versa). Developing a precise estimate for every household would require many
        more questions and accurate recall. We have opted for simplicity over precision.
